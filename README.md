# Workshop 6: Company News Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page developed as part of my web development studies at the industrial academy. It focuses on creating a clean, structured layout for a company news section using modern CSS techniques.

## 🛠️ Features

* *Semantic HTML5*: Organised using <header>, <section>, and <footer> tags for better accessibility and SEO.
* *Flexbox Layouts*: 
    * The navigation bar uses display: flex with space-between to align the logo and menu items.
    * The project "cards" use flex-wrap: wrap and gap to create a clean grid of news articles.
    * The footer links are aligned horizontally using flex properties.
* *Typography*: Integrated Ubuntu and PT Sans fonts via Google Fonts for a modern look.
* *Responsive Design*: Utilized calc() and min() functions to ensure the container scales correctly on different screen sizes.

## 📂 Project Structure

* *index.html*: The main structure of the page, including the header, news section, and social media footer.
* *style.css*: Contains all styling, including custom color palettes like #284069 (Dark Blue) and #f56013 (Orange accent).
* */images*: Folder containing the project's visual assets and social media icons.
