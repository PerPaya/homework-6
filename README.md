Workshop 6: Company News Landing Page
This project is a responsive landing page developed as part of my web development studies at the industrial academy. It focuses on creating a clean, structured layout for a company news section using modern CSS techniques.
🛠 Features
Semantic HTML5: Organised using <header>, <section>, and <footer> tags for better accessibility and SEO.
Flexbox Layouts:
The navigation bar uses display: flex with space-between to align the logo and menu items.
The project "cards" uses flex-wrap: wrap and gap to create a clean grid of news articles.
The footer links are aligned horizontally using flex properties.
Typography: Integrated Ubuntu and PT Sans fonts via Google Fonts for a modern look.
Responsive Design: Utilised calc() and min() functions to ensure the container scales correctly on different screen sizes.

style.css: Contains all styling, including custom color palettes like #284069 (Dark Blue) and #f56013 (Orange accent).
